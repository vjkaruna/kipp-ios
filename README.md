KIPP is a nationwide network of public charter schools that is dedicated to helping students gain the skills and character needed to succeed in college. These students are primarily from low-income families - about 88 percent of KIPP students qualify for federally subsidized school meals.

Built into the founding principles of KIPP is the belief that students need to build character in addition to excelling in academics. Attributes like intellectual curiosity - a willingess to expand one's horizons - can be taught and reinforced over time. 

While KIPP has a great deal of technology resources in the form of Chromebooks and online learning software, the existing behavior tracking system can be  difficult to use, including printing out hundreds of pages of progress reports for teachers. Our apps aim to solve this problem by making it easy for teachers to bridge online learning software and in-classroom time, track behaviors during class and take corrective or reinforcing action after class.
